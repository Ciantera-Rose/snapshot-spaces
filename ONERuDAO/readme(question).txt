there's a question on how to edit index.json for a voting section accordingly to the needs of ONERuDAO:
- we'd like to give a permission to vote for everyone from ru community with minimum 100 ONE on their balance (staked or not staked);
- we'd like to have 1 vote for 1 address option now;

about the 'members' section in the code span:
- while the governors are not elected can thisstaction stay empty and be edited later, when approved governors will add their wallets for the multisig option?
